## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me especially to reinforce what I learned about responsive design following the mobile first approach.

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>404 Not Found</h1>
  </header>
  <main></main>
  <footer></footer>
<body>
```
```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  main {
    display: flex;
    flex: auto;
    align-items: center;
    width: 100%;
    gap: 2rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Working on this project made me realize that there are still advanced CSS topics to learn, and at the same time it sparked my interest to use Github Pages more often for static page deployment.

### Useful resources

- [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) - This is a guide to deploy static pages using the GitHub pages service, which allows you to easily publish your website online in a few steps.
